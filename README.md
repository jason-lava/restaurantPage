# [Restaurant Page via JS]

https://jason-lava.github.io/restaurantPage/

This project is all about utilizing and learning how to effectively:
* use Webpack to bundle my project.
* use npm to build/run my project.
* use JavaScript to create all HTML elements 


# How It's Made:
Tech used:

* Javascript, Javascript, and more Javascript
* npm
* webpack

I challenged myself to script a whole website using nothing but Javascript - well mainly Javascript. There is a small framework for HTML page and of course CSS styling guide, but 95% is all Javascript.
I learned how to utilize npm and webpack better.
I learned how to better utilize Javascript to create DOM elements, attach them, how to use factory functions in conjunction with the webpage elements, and more. 
This was a fun project to deeply develop JS skills with DOM manipulation.

# Lessons Learned:

I learned how to utilize JS skills to manipulate, create, and attach webpage elements, how to better use factory functions to create en masse, how to compile via npm and webpack, and how to export and import functions.
